Single-player vs multi-player
-----------------------------
- I guess that in some ways these can really be the same thing.
  - ie, that single player is really just multi player with only one player

- QUESTION: Is the main thing to separate storage of the world state from storage of the player state? 
  - ie, not to store the world state with the player
  - Because other players might change the world state when any individual player is not playing.
